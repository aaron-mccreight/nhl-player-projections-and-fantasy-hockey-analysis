# nhl-player-projections-and-fantasy-hockey-analysis
Using machine learning to predict a player's statistics for the upcoming year and performing some data analysis to help me win my fantasy hockey league. Very much a work in progress but the analysis did help me have my best draft.
Note: Basic statistics data is from Rotowire. Advanced statistics data is from Natural Stat Trick. Plan is to use NHL API at some point but will need to learn how to calculate the advanced statistics.
